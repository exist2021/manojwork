One of the things a single man has to solve is his meal problem. Growing up in a typical patriarchal family set up I never thought I would someday have to cook.

> Eating shouldn't be fussy, but we have been so much sold on stuff like

1. Are you eating enough fibre?

2. Are you getting enough vitamins?

3. Are you gluten-sensitive?

etc, etc.

These things have made us paranoid and focus too much on our stomachs instead of our heads.

I have also gone through the entire circus of vegan, organic stuff. But then I knew if I have to accomplish anything I need to nail my diet.

I cannot afford to spend time #cooking, but my reliance on restaurant food is also not good. So I came up with a simple rule for eating meals at home.

## 555 fruit salad diet.

Last 5-6 months, I have been eating only fruits If I am at home. I have like one or two meals a day.

If I have two meals, one of the meals is just fruit. Fruits alone can get boring so I make "Panch Amrut" which is a fruit salad with five ingredients that take five minutes to make and takes about five minutes to eat.

> So for example
### My lunch was

5 bananas (smaller ones)

dates

shredded coconut

honey

Jaggery.

*This took me five minutes to cook.*

## Some more rules

Not to cook any meals (eat raw only, this saves time on cooking and cleaning)

When the digestive system is sluggish, go on a fruit-only diet.

When you do not want to drown in a sleep coma, eat fruit salad only.

Do you have any such ideas for a 555 meal?

So I am always looking for delicious recipes with the following formula. If you have anything which adheres to the above 555 rule let me know.

## Summarising the rules

Five ingredients

Five minutes to prepare

Five minutes to eat.
