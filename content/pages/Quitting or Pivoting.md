I just pivoted. In start-up lingo, it means that you change your business model to match the resources you have. 

> Pivoting politely says you have failed and run out of ideas, money or men.
## The consequences of not quitting or pivoting
Last time I got involved with a hyperlocal project lasting over a decade. I refused to give up! I steadfastly held on to my belief system that society starts outside your doorstep, and that is your neighbourhood. After a friendly pat on the back, I gave it up. I sold my business, and the new owners are doing a good job, much better than I had managed. I didn't have the skills and the resources to run them. But it took me way too long to quit the business.

I was stuck with my hyperlocal business. Money was so little that I had to take up a client who would pay my rent. But  I still stuck to it cause there was some money coming in. I didn't know when to quit. 

*Note- I am using the word quitting or pivoting alternatively here; they are synonyms.* 

> This time, I am pivoting faster.

## This year, I launched [Slowdating Venture](Slowdating.online) 
I had burnt myself in my hyperlocal project by going for a very small market; this time, I didn't want to take chances. I launched a site targeting a global audience. I got registrations from New York, Budapest, Peru and, of course, Indian cities. But the numbers are not enough. A dating business needs numbers and density. I have neither of them. 

So I have pivoted; instead of moving vertically up the value chain, I am going down the chain. I want to see where my solo skills match the business I need to run with only my time. I have launched [Dating Coach Directory](datingcoach.directory) and [Dating Coach](datingcoach.site.)

The business model is less complex here; it doesn't need people, marketing budgets, or expensive technical stuff. My options for getting revenue are much better. As I become proficient in these areas, I plan to move upwards. 

> I am writing this blog post to urge people to think when they need to pivot (quit) their existing projects and work on something the market is willing to pay.
