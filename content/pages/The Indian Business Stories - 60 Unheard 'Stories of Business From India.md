In his recent book, "[The Indian Business Stories - 60 Unheard 'Stories of Business From India](https://www.amazon.in/Indian-Business-Stories-Unheard-India-ebook)'," author Rahul Mehta attempts to shed light on the intriguing world of hostile takeovers and corporate conflicts in India. This compilation promises an interesting read for business enthusiasts with tales ranging from Ratan Tata’s battle with his old guard to the biscuit war between Nusli Wadia and Britannia. However, despite its potential, the book falls short of comprehensively exploring these narratives.

## Lacking Detail and Depth:
One cannot deny that Mehta has compiled an intriguing collection of stories highlighting India’s cutthroat nature of business. Yet, disappointment arises when readers realise that these stories are merely newspaper articles bundled together without much additional research or analysis. As a result, one can finish reading the entire book within three hours while listening on their Alexa audio device. The lack of depth is evident throughout each anecdote.

## An Opportunity Missed:
"The Indian Business Stories" had immense potential to provide readers with detailed insights into some fascinating corporate battles. Unfortunately, it seems the author missed an opportunity by not putting more effort into transforming those newspaper articles into truly insightful book. While it offers a glimpse into various takeover bids and disputes, readers are left craving deeper analysis and context.

## Value for Kindle Unlimited Subscribers:
If you have a Kindle subscription, this book might still be worth exploring since it is free. It offers bite-sized accounts of significant business conflicts in India's history, which may pique your interest enough to dive deeper into individual cases or conduct further research.

## Shining Light on Neglected Topics:
One commendable aspect of Mehta's work is its focus on shedding light on hostile takeovers and corporate conflicts in India—a topic often overlooked or under-researched compared to other aspects of the business landscape. By highlighting these stories, Mehta brings attention to a subject that deserves more exploration and analysis.

## Conclusion:
In conclusion, "The Indian Business Stories - 60 Unheard 'Stories of Business From India'" provides an interesting but shallow compilation of takeover bids and corporate disputes in India. While it offers a glimpse into some captivating narratives, readers will be left wanting more depth and analysis. If you want a quick read or wish to familiarise yourself with key events in Indian business history, this book may suffice. However, if you seek comprehensive insights and detailed accounts, you should explore additional resources on each case separately.
