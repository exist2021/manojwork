## New Personal Blog Platform

  + I did some tinkering and changed my blog platform. I wanted a blog which looks like interconnected notes. So I went over to [[logseq]] publishing but the plugin developer has not sorted the linked references bug, which is the most important part of publishing connected notes. But the blog doesn’t look so bad after all, check out [https://manojnayak.blog](https://manojnayak.blog/?utm_campaign=Newsletter%20from%20Manoj%20Nayak&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter)

## New Persona Blog Platform

  + Also, I made my other domain [https://manojnayak.com](https://manojnayak.com/?utm_campaign=Newsletter%20from%20Manoj%20Nayak&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) in to a landing page for all my social links. I built in under five minutes on [Popsy]({{< ref "Popsy" >}}) .
