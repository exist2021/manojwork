Deliverables might include designs, reports, reviews, and final products. This is where more granular planning breaks the project milestones into smaller assets and sets due dates according to the Roadmap timelines. These deliverables will guide project managers. as they assign individual task work across the team.



### Tips for planning your project roadmap deliverables.

Break down each project milestone into smaller, individual deliverables.

Identify which deliverables are non-negotiable priorities vs tasks that could be deprioritized if a blocker arises. 

Establish due dates for when each deliverable should be completed to stay on track with your set milestones. 

Note which deliverables are going to be internal vs externally completed. 

Create a plan for how individual contributors will be assigned independent task work and how dependencies will be managed to hit goals on time.



## Resources
