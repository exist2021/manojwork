Recently, I had the pleasure of reading a book [India is Broken : A People Betrayed, 1947 to Today](https://www.amazon.in/India-Broken-People-Betrayed-Today/dp/9393986576/ref=sr_1_2?keywords=India+Is+Broken+by+Ashoka+Mody&qid=1686136596&sr=8-2) by Ashoka Mody that delves into the economic history of India from independence to the present day. The book explores the policies of Indian prime ministers from Nehru to Narendra Modi and argues that they have all shortchanged India by focusing on the wrong priorities.

Mody’s main argument is that Indian prime ministers have focused too much on building temples and other infrastructure projects instead of investing in primary education. While other Asian countries like South Korea, Taiwan, and Japan have focused on primary education and seen great success, India has fallen behind.

The book also delves into the policies of individual prime ministers, such as Indira son Sanjay Gandhi's forced sterilization program and his creation of Maruti, which was initially a failure until it changed management. Additionally, Mody discusses the relationship between the Indira & Rajiv Gandhi’s with industrialists like Dhirubhai Ambani.

Overall, I found this book to be an incredibly interesting read that offers a unique perspective on India's economic history. It is a must-read for anyone interested in understanding the policies of Indian prime ministers and the impact they have had on the country's economic development. It is time for India to prioritize primary education and catch up to other successful Asian countries.
