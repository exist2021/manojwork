In today's society, many believe that the key to success is working hard and making a lot of money. However, working for love, rather than solely for financial gain, is the true path to success and fulfilment.

While working for love may not always result in a high income, it allows for a deeper connection to one's work and a sense of purpose that can be even more valuable than money. When we work for love, we can tap into our passions and talents and use them to create something meaningful.

However, to achieve financial success, leverage is necessary. Traditionally, there are several types of leverage, including capital, human resources, media leverage, code, and content. Out of all of these, managing human resources is the most difficult and valuable skill.

Managing people requires unique skills and abilities, It is the art of getting things done from others, and if mastered, it can lead to significant financial rewards. Whether you have the capital or not, managing human resources is essential for success in any industry.

In conclusion, while working for love may not always result in financial wealth, it can lead to a fulfilling and purposeful career. And while leverage is necessary for financial success, mastering the art of managing human resources is the key to unlocking it.
