Sheela Reddy's book, "[Mr and Mrs Jinnah](https://www.amazon.com/Mr-Mrs-Jinnah-Sheela-Reddy/dp/0670093323)," offers an insightful look into the controversial marriage between Ruttie Petit (daughter of one of the wealthiest man of India)and Jinnah. The author delves deep into their personal lives, exploring their relationships with each other and those around them.

The story begins when Jinnah asks Ruttie's father for her hand in marriage. At just 14 years old, Ruttie was far too young to marry according to societal norms, causing tension with her father. Despite this, they were in love, which ultimately led to their union four years later when Ruttie turned 18.

However, their age difference proved to be a significant hurdle in their relationship. While Ruttie was modern and forward-thinking, Jinnah was absorbed in his work as a politician and didn't appreciate her involvement. As a result of this disconnect between them, the couple had an unhappy marriage.

Ruttie tried to find purpose outside of her marriage by getting involved with esoteric groups like Annie Besant's Theosophy society. However, she suffered from poor health that eventually led to depression before dying (suspected of over dosing with sleeping pills)at just 29 years old.
After her death, Fatima - Jinnah's younger sister who grew up like his daughter - became increasingly religiously conservative. This shift played a role in Jinnah becoming more hardline about Islam and supporting India's painful partition.

It is interesting to consider how different things could have been if Ruttie had lived longer or if Jinnah had not turned towards hardline Islam after her death. This highlights how personal relationships can shape history significantly.

Understanding the internal lives of powerful people is crucial in understanding our world today; it is not only about their public image or accomplishments but also about their personal struggles and relationships. In this case study on Mr & Mrs Jinnah, Ruttie was a sexually liberated woman who traveled alone and probably had affairs. This behavior did not sit well with Jinnah and contributed to the downfall of their marriage.

The book is based on letters written by Ruttie to Sarojini Naidu and her daughter Padmaja, offering a fascinating glimpse into the personal lives of two historical figures whose relationship had far-reaching consequences.

Overall, "Mr & Mrs Jinnah" is an eye-opening read that reminds us how personal relationships can shape history significantly. Understanding the internal lives of powerful people is crucial in understanding our world today; it's not only about their public image or accomplishments but also about their personal struggles and relationships.
