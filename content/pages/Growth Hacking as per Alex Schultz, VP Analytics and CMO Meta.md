## Alex mostly talks about retention rates.

  + He says before Facebook, companies were talking about the total number of users.

  + Zuck focussed on [MAU]({{< ref "MAU" >}}) (Monthly Active Users)

  + He says [MAU]({{< ref "MAU" >}}) will vary and will be different as per the type of company. For example for an e-commerce company, a retention rate of says 30-40% is good, but for a social network it has to be above 80%/

## Then He talks about Magic Moments after Signups

  + He says once a user signed into Facebook, he would see FB friends suggestions, that he says is the magic moment for the user.

## North Star Metric

  + He says one of their most important metrics besides [MAU]({{< ref "MAU" >}}) was to get the user ten friends in 14 days.

  + Another important metric for them was to scale up Internationally as they were late to launch.
