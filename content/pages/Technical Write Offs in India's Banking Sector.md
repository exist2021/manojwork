Technical write-offs in India's banking sector have become a topic of interest and debate due to their impact on the financial health of banks and the overall economy. These write-offs, which are done for accounting purposes, have the potential to boost banks' finances and reduce their tax liabilities. However, there are concerns about the economic and government debt effects that these write-offs may have.

## Technical Write-Offs and Non-Performing Assets

One significant development in this area came with Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s decision to reduce the number of public sector banks from 20 to 12. This move was aimed at addressing the issue of non-performing assets (NPAs) that had been plaguing these banks. While it has been successful in reducing NPAs, it is important to note that the main beneficiaries of this consolidation are large borrowers who hold loans above five crores.

In India, technical write-offs have reached a staggering total of nearly one trillion rupees[3]. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has not disclosed the identities of these creditors but has listed them in a defaulter register. This lack of transparency raises concerns about accountability and fairness in the banking sector.

## Technical Write-Offs and Wilful Defaulters

Both public and private banks engage in loan write-offs, with public sector banks accounting for 75% of such actions[5]. Many of these write-offs fall under the category of technical write-offs, where recovery prospects are low. In fact, only 15% of NPAs are deemed recoverable[5].

Another disturbing trend is the rise in wilful defaulters who deliberately obtain loans without providing collateral. These individuals have managed to secure loans amounting to nearly eight thousand crores, further straining the already burdened banking system[2].

## Transparency and Accountability

The beneficiaries of these technical write-offs deserve closer scrutiny as they could potentially impact economic growth. A thorough analysis is necessary to understand how these actions affect various sectors and whether they contribute positively or negatively to overall development.

To achieve this understanding, it is crucial to promote increased transparency and accountability within the banking sector. This includes disclosing the identities of creditors benefiting from write-offs and establishing mechanisms to track the impact of these actions on economic growth.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, technical write-offs play a significant role in India’s banking sector by improving banks' finances and reducing tax liabilities. However, their economic and government debt effects are still unclear. The concentration of benefits towards large borrowers raises questions about fairness, while the lack of transparency surrounding these actions calls for increased accountability. To fully understand the impact of technical write-offs on economic growth, further discussions are required alongside greater banking transparency and accountability measures. By opening up a discussion on technical write-offs and their implications, policymakers, regulators, and stakeholders can work together to create a more robust banking system. This would involve implementing reforms that prioritize transparency, accountability, and fairness in loan write-offs.
