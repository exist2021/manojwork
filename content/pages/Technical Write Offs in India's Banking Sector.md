Technical write-offs in India's banking sector have become a topic of interest and debate due to their impact on the financial health of banks and the overall economy. These write-offs, which are done for accounting purposes, have the potential to boost banks' finances and reduce their tax liabilities. However, there are concerns about the economic and government debt effects that these write-offs may have.

## Technical Write-Offs and Non-Performing Assets

One significant development in this area came with Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s decision to reduce the number of public sector banks from 27 to 12. This move aimed to address the issue of non-performing assets (NPAs) plaguing these banks. While it has been successful in reducing NPAs, it is important to note that the main beneficiaries of this consolidation are large borrowers who hold loans above five crores.

In India, technical write-offs have reached a staggering total of nearly one trillion rupees[3]. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has not disclosed the identities of these creditors but has listed them in a defaulter register. This lack of transparency raises concerns about accountability and fairness in the banking sector.

## Technical Write-Offs and Wilful Defaulters

Both public and private banks engage in loan write-offs, with public sector banks accounting for 75% of such actions[5]. Many of these write-offs fall under the category of technical write-offs, where recovery prospects are low. In fact, only 15% of NPAs are deemed recoverable[5].

Another disturbing trend is the rise in wilful defaulters who deliberately obtain loans without providing collateral. For example, Just Geetanjali group has will fully defaulted to the tune of nearly eight thousand crores. These entities have managed to secure loans further straining the already burdened banking system[2].

## Transparency and Accountability

The beneficiaries of these technical write-offs deserve closer scrutiny as they could potentially impact economic growth. A thorough analysis is necessary to understand how these actions affect various sectors and whether they contribute positively or negatively to overall development.

To achieve this understanding, it is crucial to promote increased transparency and accountability within the banking sector. This includes disclosing the identities of creditors benefiting from write-offs and establishing mechanisms to track the impact of these actions on economic growth.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, technical write-offs play a significant role in India’s banking sector by improving banks' finances and reducing tax liabilities. However, their economic and government debt effects are still unclear. The concentration of benefits towards large borrowers raises questions about fairness, while the lack of transparency surrounding these actions calls for increased accountability. To fully understand the impact of technical write-offs on economic growth, further discussions are required alongside greater banking transparency and accountability measures. By opening up a discussion on technical write-offs and their implications, policymakers, regulators, and stakeholders can work together to create a more robust banking system. This would involve implementing reforms that prioritize transparency, accountability, and fairness in loan write-offs.

# FAQ’s

## What steps did the Indian government and RBI take to address the bad loan problem in the country's banking sector.

In 2015, the then RBI governor Raghuram Rajan initiated an "asset-quality review" to identify and address the extent of bad loans. This led to write-downs and failures in sectors like energy, steel, and telecoms.

In 2016, the government implemented bankruptcy reforms to expedite the liquidation of failing firms and encourage delinquent businesses to repay their dues. These reforms played a significant role in addressing the bad loan problem and improving the banks' financial health.

The government announced the consolidation of 27 state-owned banks into 12 in 2019, aiming to strengthen the banks and enhance their ability to deal with bad loans.

Indian state banks wrote off approximately $91 billion in bad loans over the past five years. This helped clean up the system, remove non-performing assets, and allow fresh lending, improving the sector's stability and profitability. 

Mechanisms like the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code facilitated the recovery of bad loans. Banks recovered significant amounts from defaulters, reducing non-performing assets.

The Modi government also initiated cleanup and consolidation of weaker public sector banks with stronger ones to address non-performing assets (NPAs). They separated the financial from criminal aspects when dealing with defaults, making it easier to address the problem.

The government's banking reforms significantly reduced gross NPAs, and many public sector banks returned to profitability after years of losses. 

Overall, the government's efforts improved the banking sector by addressing NPAs, increasing profits, and strengthening banks' resilience to shocks.

# What are experts saying about the transparency and fairness of the write-off process?

Experts have raised concerns about the transparency and fairness of the write-off process in the Indian banking sector. They argue that there is a lack of transparency in the process, with loans of big defaulters often being written off while small-time borrowers receive no such leniency from banks. This lack of transparency destroys the credit risk management system and raises questions about accountability and fairness within the banking sector. Experts also emphasize the need for a policy governing write-offs and scrutiny of these actions. They believe that write-offs should be used sparingly and only when essential, with all efforts taken to recover the money. Furthermore, experts criticize the practice of technical write-offs, which reduces incentives to recover and introduces non-transparency into the system. The lack of disclosure of the identities of creditors benefiting from write-offs is also seen as a hindrance to transparency and accountability. Overall, experts advocate for increased transparency, accountability, and fairness in the write-off process to ensure a more robust banking system.

# What is technical debt and how does it relate to the banking sector?

Technical debt refers to the cost that banks have to bear in the future due to the decisions made in the present. It is a concept that originated in the software development industry but has found relevance in the banking sector. In the banking sector, technical debt primarily arises from poor financial management and inadequate risk assessment.

In the context of Indian banks, technical debt accumulation occurs due to factors such as the issuance of risky loans that eventually turn into non-performing assets (NPAs). Regulatory policies and the economic environment also play a significant role in the accumulation of technical debt. Therefore, managing technical debt is crucial for the financial stability of banks and the broader economy.

The implications of technical debt write-offs in the banking sector are far-reaching. Removing technical debt from the balance sheets can improve the appearance of profitability, but if not managed properly, it can lead to bankruptcy. Furthermore, the write-offs can affect the banks' credit rating and investor confidence, further complicating their financial situation.

Overall, technical debt is an important concept in the banking sector as it highlights the long-term costs associated with present decisions. Proper management of technical debt is crucial for the financial stability of banks and the overall health of the economy.
