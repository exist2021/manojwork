Systems thinking is an approach to problem-solving and decision-making that views the world as a series of interconnected and interdependent systems, rather than a set of isolated and disconnected parts. It is an interdisciplinary approach that draws on principles from multiple fields, including systems theory, ecology, computer science, and psychology. 

In systems thinking, the focus is on identifying the relationships and interactions between the components of a system, rather than analyzing them in isolation. This allows for a more holistic and comprehensive understanding of a problem, which helps in developing effective solutions that address the root causes of the problem. 

Systems thinking is used in a variety of fields such as environmental sustainability, public policy, healthcare, and business management. It can be a powerful tool for analyzing complex problems and identifying opportunities for improvement.
