You will probably end up breaking your back than becoming rich by working your ass off.

## Here is what will make you rich

If you want to get rich, you need to get into positions of Power and develop a very good understanding of [systems thinking]({{< ref "systems thinking" >}}). I talk about the four types of Power in my [earlier blog post](https://www.manoj.work/pages/chanakyas-four-rules-of-power/). If you want to understand systems thinking, I recommend this excellent book called [Thinking in Systems](https://www.amazon.in/Thinking-Systems-Donella-H-Meadows-ebook/dp/B005VSRFEA/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1682923595&sr=8-3). I have made my highlights of the book public here [Thinking in Systems (highlights)]({{< ref "Thinking in Systems (highlights)" >}})

## So why work? 

Work for the joy of being in flow, work for the joy of completing a project (which will never make you money), work for the joy of creation, work for the love of art, work for the love of music or dance. Work to express yourself. **But don’t you dare work for money.**
